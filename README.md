# Pricing_data_analysis
In this [project](code.ipynb), I used pandas and numpy in Python to analyse pricing data.

Topic 1: 
Using [timeseries pricing data](AAPL.csv), I grouped the daily percent change into 4 categories (High+, High-, Low+, Low-), and then summarize the characteristics of these 4 categories.

Topic 2: 
I constructed a dataframe that contains product orders and prices information, and generated sales insights, including the customer value, profitable product, and popular customer product pair.
